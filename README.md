# Financial-Scripting
yfinance scripting

Hi everyone, I created a quick script to move financials over from Yahoo Finance via Yfinance, which uses the Yahoo API to pull financials.
In this project, I just wanted to pull financials over into a spreadsheet, and forecast future growth based on some assumptions. Being able to understand the Holy Trinity of Accounting(Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Statement of Cash Flows)
and how things can move is important as an analyst.

As of November, some things in Yfinance have changed, further research in yfinances github will have to be done.

Thank you.
Gideon
